## Instructions

It is helpful to install Node Version Manager (nvm) so that your system can more easily manage multiple versions of NodeJS and associated packages.

You can do this by following instructions at https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating

Alternatively, configure your environment to use NodeJS v10

```nvm install v10.20.0

nvm use v10.20.0

npm install -g truffle

npm install

truffle develop

test
```
